# CMSIS Pack Generation 

The utility `packgen` assists the generation of a CMSIS Pack from CMakeLists according to the standard [format](https://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/Pack/html/packFormat.html) by reading a manifest YAML file with metadata and running the CMake generation step to retrieve CMake targets build information, namely source files, include paths and defines. 

## Requirements

- CMake: https://cmake.org/
- Ninja: https://ninja-build.org/
- Any requirement needed for running the CMake generation step over the CMake project has to be previously configured. Currently aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C requires Linux. See [Configuring Demos](../../README.md#configuring-demos).

In addition for validating and compressing pack files, the `PackChk` and `7z` utilities shall be in the `PATH`:
- PackChk: https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/tree/master/CMSIS/Utilities/
- 7z: https://www.7-zip.org/
 

## Quick Start

The example input file [cmsis.yml](../../cmsis.yml) describes several AWS IoT SDK components and their inter-dependencies.
<br />
The demonstration pack can be generated by cloning the following forked branch and executing packgen tool:
```
git clone -b packgen-cmake --recurse-submodules https://github.com/brondani/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C.git
cd aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C
tools/cmsis/linux64/packgen --manifest cmsis.yml
```
The generated pack files will be stored in the `generated` folder.

## Usage

```
CMSIS Pack generator assistant 0.9.0
Usage:
  packgen [OPTION...]

  -m, --manifest arg  Manifest YAML file
  -r, --regenerate    Rerun CMake generation step
  -v, --verbose       Verbose mode
  -h, --help          Print usage
  ```

## Brief description

- The contents of a `component` are retrieved from the input manifest file and from the CMake targets associated to it. If several CMake targets are listed, the build information (source files, include paths and defines) will be merged. The build information of other components or CMake targets listed as `dependencies` will be filtered out.
- External dependencies of a component can be added to the `conditions` list. When an internal component is listed as dependency, a `require` condition is automatically inserted.
- Files that are not among the build information such as config files can still join a component by adding them to the `files` list.
- After changing CMakeLists and/or CMake targets, use the tool option --regenerate to rerun the CMake generation step.
- Currently only a single CMake generation step is supported. By combining several generation steps with different build options the tool will be able to assist the automation of different scenarios (TBD).

## CMSIS manifest file

The YAML structure is described below.
